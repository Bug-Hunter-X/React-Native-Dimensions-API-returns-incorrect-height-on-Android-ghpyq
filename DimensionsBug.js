This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android. The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` might return incorrect values, particularly the height.  This often happens when the app is launched or when the screen orientation changes.  The problem is that these values may not yet have been fully calculated or updated. The height might be reported as 0 or some incorrect value. The width is less likely to be affected.

```javascript
//Incorrect usage
const {width, height} = Dimensions.get('window');
console.log('Width:', width);
console.log('Height:', height);
//Height may be 0 or inaccurate initially
```
